A slowly growing collection of useful thing for woodworking workshop.

The first one, it's parametric [drill press table](./drill_press/readme.md), with mobile base and cabinet for Dedra DED 7807 drill press. However you can modify it for any (bench-top) drill press. All details were cut on [`MPCNC`](https://docs.v1e.com/mpcnc/intro/), however you can use table saw + router. `cnc` directory contain `.gcode` files for Marlin controller.
