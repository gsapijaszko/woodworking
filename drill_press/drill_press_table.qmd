Parametric drill press table, mobile base and cabinet for Dedra DED 7807 drill press. However you can modify it for any (bench-top) drill press. All details were cut on [`MPCNC`](https://docs.v1e.com/mpcnc/intro/), however you can use table saw + router. `cnc` directory contain `.gcode` files for Marlin controller. 

## Table

Table, shown on picture below is inspired by [@DrillPressTable2007] article. The design is metric and fully parametric, overall dimensions are 720 x 420 mm (for details see `Spreadsheet` in `drill_press_table.FCStd` file). It contain 4 open slots for clamping, 2 T-track to position fence and to attach jigs and fixtures. Table is made from 2 layers of 18 mm birch plywood. Fence is made from 32 mm plywood, it provides a beefy support. The fence faces have T-tracks build in as well, it gives the possibility to attach hold-downs and stop blocks. Inserts below iron table are based on Woodsmith article [@coplandDillPressTable2005].
